# Advent of Code 2022

This is the first year I've even heard of Advent of Code, and naturally I got a late start. You can find my solutions to all of the days I was able to solve here, and if I'm not able to solve it I'll leave a link to someone who was.

I'll be covering my solutions on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@valhalla_dev) and will leave links to the videos covering my solutions in this README.

Merry Christmas and happy hacking!
